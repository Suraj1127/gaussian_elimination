# gaussian_elimination
This python program solves the system of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination.  Here, the system assumes n equations of n degree given in the input.  

Gaussian Elimination:
(From Wikipedia)

In linear algebra, Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) is an algorithm for 
solving systems of linear equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of operations 
performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to 
find the rank of a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and to calculate the 
inverse of an invertible square matrix. The method is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777â€“1855), 
although it was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 179 CE.

Instructions:
Run main.py and enter the inputs as asked.  The solution array will be printed on the basis of input you entered if it exists.
